What is CS-4820-Library Project?

This organization exists as a place to organize various projects done by teams of University of Prince Edward Island computer science students through the "capstone" CS4810-CS4820 2-semester course. The projects in this organization are all done with the UPEI librarian Melissa Belvadi acting in the role of "client", providing the project requirements and primary design support and guidance. The projects included here span multiple years ("cohorts") of student teams taking that course.
